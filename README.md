# Fake News Detection

This project aims to build a machine learning model to accurately classify a news article as real or fake.
Project Structure

### Structure:

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

3. Feature Engineering.

4. Model Training, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest.

5. Model Evaluation.

6. Prediction.

### Models Used

- Logistic Regression: A statistical model that uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable.

- Decision Tree: A flowchart-like model, where each internal node denotes a test on an attribute, each branch represents an outcome of the test, and each leaf node holds a class label.

- Gradient Boosting: A machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees.

- Random Forest: A type of ensemble machine learning model which builds multiple decision trees and merges them together to get a more accurate and stable prediction.

### Requirements

- Python 3
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- re
- string
Usage

To use this project, run the fake news detection.ipynb notebook. You can input a news article and the model will predict whether it's fake or real.
